# Play-store-app-user-review-analysis
Introduction-
Hello everyone, today in my project  we are going to see that how  mobile apps present in the Play store is playing an important role in our life. So as we are going to do analysis on  the Google Play Store apps, so first of all know about Google play store, so Google play store  is the most popular and most using android app store. It has a  millions number of applications which we are using in our daily life to make our work softer. It provides us a collection of datas  like ratings, price and number of downloads and apps description. its an important role for the developers to know which apps are accepted  by the users and loved most. So that they can improve the apps and can be different from the other  applications. To make their work simpler we will perform an EDA (Exploratory data analysis) here. So EDA is besically an approch of analyzing data sets to summerize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data vizualisation methood.

Problem statements-
1- Which category of apps has more important in accordance to public demand?
2- The category which is most popular category, check how much of them are free and paid?
3- We will analyze that whether free or paid apps has more in number?
4- Which app category has most number of downloads?
5- Which category of apps has highest reviews?
6- Which genres of app is most popular?

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA)-
As we discussed above that EDA is basically an approch of analyzing data sets to summerize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data vizualisation methood.
EDA involves generating summary statistics for numerical data in the dataset and creating various graphical representations to understand the data better and make it more attractive and appealing.

The steps that we are going to perform in our EDA is discussed bellow,

Problem Statement - First of all we will understand the given data set. Then We will study and analyse  the attributes present in the data set and then we will perform a philosophical analysis on their importance to this problem.

Hypothesis - After looking on the attributes that are present in our  data base, we will  apply some basic hypothesis by which we can analyze with the data and get results.

Univariate Analysis - It is the simplest form of analyzing the data. In this we would initially pick up a single attribute and study it in and out. It doesn't deal with any sort of co-relation and it's major purpose is to describe. It takes data, summarizes that data and finds patterns in the data.

Bivariate Analysis - This analysis is related to cause and the relationship between the two attributes. We will try to understand the dependency of attributes on each other.

Multivariate Analysis - This is done when more than two variables have to be analyzed simultaneously.

Data Cleaning - In data cleaning We will clean the dataset which has the missing value, outliers and NaN values.

Testing Hypothesis - Here we will check if our data meets the assumptions required by most of the multivariate techniques.

ANALYSIS SUMMARY-

In our project of analyzing play store applications, we haveto  worke on several parameters which will help to developer to launching their own apps on the play store with hogh quality.I First of all we will focus on the problem statements and data cleaning, in order to ensure that we give them the best results out of our analysis.
Developing an app related to the least categories as they are not explored much. Like events and beauty. Most of the apps are Free, so focusing on free app is more important. Focusing more on content available for Everyone will increase the chances of getting the highest installs. They need to focus on updating their apps regularly, so that it will attract more users. They need to keep in mind that the sentiments of the user keep varying as they keep using the app, so they should focus more on users needs and features.

CONCLUSION-
After my Analysis I found that in the play store app data

1- has a total 34 number of app category.And I found that there is a huge demand of app in Family category than other categories. And the number of apps in the category of Family is around 2000.

2- Family category app is most popular app and in this category the number of free apps is 1750 and paid is 250.

3- The total number of free app number is more than paid.

4- The video player category has the maximum nuber of installs.

5- The Business category apps has highest reviews.

6- The apps under Tools Genres are most popular.
